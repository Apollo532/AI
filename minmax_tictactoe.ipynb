It is used to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that the opponent is also playing optimally\n","\n","The key to the Minimax algorithm is a back and forth between the two players, where the player whose \"turn it is\" desires to pick the move with the maximum score. In turn, the scores for each of the available moves are determined by the opposing player deciding which of its available moves has the minimum score. And the scores for the opposing players moves are again determined by the turn-taking player trying to maximize its score and so on all the way down the move tree to an end state."],"metadata":{"id":"WhXQRJeIgYFk"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["WHY TO USE THE MINMAX ALGORITHM IN TIC TAC TOE ?\n","\n","The Minimax Tic-Tac-Toe algorithm is impossible to beat, and when two Minimaxes play against each other, every move they make is the best response to what the opponent could possibly do (Nash equilibrium), resulting in 100% chance of a draw."],"metadata":{"id":"jryg2CvthvHZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["HOW TO USE
