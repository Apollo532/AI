Generally, the apriori algorithm operates on a database containing a huge number of transactions. For example, the items customers but at a Big Bazar.\n","\n","Apriori is generally considered an unsupervised learning approach, since it's often used to discover or mine for interesting patterns and relationships. Apriori can also be modified to do classification based on labelled data."],"metadata":{"id":"2G801HV_NWZa"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["WHY TO USE APRIORI ALGORITHM?\n","\n","The Apriori algorithm is used for mining frequent itemsets and devising association rules from a transactional database. The parameters “support” and “confidence” are used. Support refers to items' frequency of occurrence; confidence is a conditional probability. Items in a transaction form an item set.\n","\n","An essential feature known as the Apriori property is utilized to boost the effectiveness of level-wise production of frequent itemsets. This property helps by minimizing the search area, which in turn serves to maximize the productivity of level-wise creation of frequent
